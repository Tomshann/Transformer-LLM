# Transformer-LLM
My first context based chatbot using the Transformer architecture

This model was trained using the ambigQA dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/sewon/ambig_qa

Due to the training dataset being very small the model is very limited in the quality of output produced based on context however it recognises tokens well and produces legible words although the full response context may not be perfect
